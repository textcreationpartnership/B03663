            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>LICENSED, and Enter'd according to Order.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Antients never Design'd their Heroes for any great Work, but they▪ endow'd him with Parts and Qualities proportionable to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end. Thus <hi>Hercules</hi> had strength to support the Pillars, and Courage to subdue the <hi>Numideaan Lyon. Jupiter</hi> slew a Serpent in the Cradle, and his Son <hi>Mars</hi> (Destin'd for no less than the God of War) lay Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Two Months in his Father's Thigh, before he was born, when less than Nine Months, sometimes, would serve for the Production of Inferiour Gods and Goddesses.</p>
            <p>Nor has this been the Theory of Former Times, but the Practice of all Ages ever since; as the Knights in our Legends, who must be alwayes supposed to overcome the Gyant: This is most Fatal to the Credulous <hi>Irish,</hi> who are apter to believe Tradition than Truth; and the meanest Priest, before the boasted Founder of their Church.</p>
            <p>What Monsters have the <hi>Irish</hi>-Historians made their <hi>Heber,</hi> and their <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the first Conquerors of <hi>Ireland;</hi> no less Prodigious than the Tales of <hi>Bryan Boro,</hi> and <hi>Fin Mac. Hengle;</hi> of whom a Learned <hi>Bard</hi> thus Elegantly Sings.
<q>
                  <l>Who never did his<note n="*" place="margin">Horse.</note> Garran ride,</l>
                  <l>But in the Compass of his stride.</l>

                  <l>And Valleys were his Stirrup-Irons.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Character of this great General, his Grace the Duke of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Notions they have formed of him in <hi>Ireland</hi>) yet no less Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and goes down as currant, as the Legend of <hi>Ossullevan.</hi> Whether begot out of Terrour, or industriously given out by the Priests, to perswade the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a voluntary Submission, I know not; but it is a certainly believed, as it is reported, that he is in Statute Sixteen Foot High, with all parts proportionable. The form of a Shooe was made, and presented to the Army, that they might guess at the rest, <hi>ex pede Herculis.</hi> He is like <hi>Achilles,</hi> invulnerable; can stride over his Army like a <hi>Rhodian Colossus,</hi> and guard them from the Enemies shot. His Mustaches are like two Barbers-poles. His Beard White, and broad as the main Sail of a First-Rate-Ship; if it Rains, he can command his Army into close Order, and cover them with his Beard, as <hi>Garragantua</hi> did with his Tongue.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:175906:2"/>
            <p> To make him Immortal, as he is Invulnerable, he is Reported to be three hundred years old, the age of <hi>Nestor;</hi> has Pistols will do Execution six miles off; which keeps the Enemy at such a distance, that they dare not come within six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles of his Camp: He can, like the <hi>Lydian</hi> Monster, stretch forth his Head, and snatch away the Horse and Man out of the third Rank. When the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bring in a Booty of Cattle, they Report, he will take a Brace of Bullocks, toss them like two Oranges upon the palm of his Hands, and tell you within half a stone the weight of either. There are other things as Foolish as Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, which they give out, and believe of this famous Warriour, to whom their fears have already assign'd the Conquest of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To confirm this, There are Prophesies disperst, which were writ in the Original Language, a Thousand years ago.</p>
            <p>The first was found in the Foundation of an old Chappel, in digging up the Trenches before <hi>Droghedah:</hi> it was carefully laid up in an old Iron Pot; the <hi>Rolls</hi> of Parchment, in which was with the Prophesies, inclos'd in an old Steel Snuff-Box. Thus translated.
<q>
                  <l>In Eighty Nine, when <hi>Teague's</hi> run down,</l>
                  <l>A<note n="*" place="margin">Kirk.</note>Church is fixt in <hi>Dublin-Town.</hi>
                  </l>

                  <l>The<note n="‖" place="margin">K. Ja.</note>Lyon hide himself for fear.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As if this were enough to confirm their Jealousie, the Priest he lends his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand, and gives them a Cast of his Office; digging in an old Vault in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Abby in <hi>Oxmon. Town, Dublin,</hi> to bury a great Officer that was killed in the Camp; In an Earthen Pot (as carefully laid up as the other) they found or made this Prophesie. In <hi>English</hi> thus,
<q>
                  <l>Not <hi>Schomberg,</hi> Shamrog more in fame,</l>
                  <l>Shall long to<note n="*" place="margin">Shamrogshire.</note>
                     <hi>Ireland,</hi> give a name,</l>
                  <l>In Sixteen-Hundred Eighty-Nine,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Shamrog</hi> to <hi>Schomberg</hi> shall Resigne,<note place="margin">Schomberg-shire.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>And from his Conquests, in that year,</l>
                  <l>Shall thence be Christned <hi>Schomberg-Shire.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they make him their <hi>Irish-Scanderbeg,</hi> and not only frighten their Children, but their Armies with his name.</p>
            <p>May their fears prove effectual; Their Prophesies come to pass, and speedy Conquest crown this Invincible Hero with Success.</p>
